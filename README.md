# Thought process
Here's my thought process for this assignment. I mapped Task A and B in separate parts of the thought map.
# Challenges
I actually didn't face too many challenges when getting into this assignment. However, I was thrown for a bit of a loop when I saw I needed to overload the constructors for Task B. I didn't actually know what that meant at first, but then I saw in the reading that overloaded constructors are the constructors that you make for when a program calls a constructor using file-specific parameters that overwrite the default constructor.
